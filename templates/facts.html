            <p><b>Added Sugar Is a Disaster for your health</b></p>
            <p>
          To improve the taste of processed foods, producers often add sugar to them. This type of sugar is known as added sugar.
          Common types of added sugar include table sugar (sucrose) and syrups, such as high-fructose corn syrup.
          Everyone knows that eating too much added sugar is unhealthy.
          While some think sugar is a simple matter of “empty” calories, others believe it increases the risk of diseases that kill millions of people each year.
          It is definitely true that added sugar contains empty calories. There are no nutrients in it, other than sugar. As a result, basing your diet on products high in added sugar may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.
          But this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many other risks associated with excessive sugar intake that are now reaching mainstream attention.
          Added sugar is being implicated as a leading cause of obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes (1Trusted Source).
           </p>
          <p><b>Artificial Trans Fats Are Very Unhealthy</b></p>
          <p>Trans fats form in chemically processed oils and are linked to all sorts of chronic diseases. You should avoid them like the plague.
          Trans fats are formed as a side product when vegetable oils are hydrogenated.
          Food producers often use hydrogenation to harden vegetable oils for use in products such as margarine.
          Because trans fats have been linked with poor health, margarine free of trans fats is becoming increasingly common.
          A high intake of trans fats is associated with various chronic diseases, such as abdominal obesity, inflammation and heart disease</p>
          <p><b>Eating Vegetables Will Improve Your Health</b></p>
          <p>Vegetables are good for you.
          They are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants and an endless variety of trace nutrients that science has just begun to uncover.</p>
          <p><b> It Is Critical to Avoid a Vitamin D Deficiency</p></b>
          <p>Vitamin D is a unique vitamin that actually functions as a hormone in the body.
          The skin makes vitamin D when it is exposed to ultraviolet rays from the sun. This is how people got most of their daily requirement throughout evolution.
          However, a large part of the world is deficient in this critical nutrient today.
          In many places, the sun simply isn’t available throughout most of the year.
          Even where there is sun, many people tend to stay inside and use sunscreen when they go out. Sunscreen effectively blocks vitamin D generation in the skin.
          If you’re deficient in vitamin D, then you’re actually lacking a major hormone in the body. </p>
          <p><b>Refined Carbohydrates Are Bad for You</b></p>
          <p>There are a lot of differing opinions about carbs and fat.
          
          Some think fat is the root of all evil, while others believe carbs are the key players in obesity and other chronic diseases.
          But what pretty much everyone agrees on is that refined carbohydrates are not as healthy as unrefined carbohydrates.
          Unrefined carbs are basically whole foods that are rich in carbs. These include whole-grain cereals, beans, vegetables and fruits. Refined carbs, on the other hand, are sugar and refined flour.
          Whole foods contain numerous beneficial nutrients and antioxidants.
          However, when high-carb foods such as grains are processed, the most nutritious parts are stripped off. What is left are massive amounts of easily digestible starch.
          Those who base their diets on refined carbs may be lacking in fiber and many other healthy nutrients. As a result, they are at an increased risk of chronic disease
          </p>
          <p><b>Supplements Can Never Fully Replace Real Foods</p></b>
          <p>“Nutritionism” is the idea that foods are nothing more than the sum of their individual nutrients.
          But it’s also a trap that many nutrition enthusiasts tend to fall into.
          Nuts, for example, aren’t just shells loaded with polyunsaturated fat. In the same way, fruits aren’t just watery bags of sugar.
          These are real foods with a massive variety of trace nutrients.
          The vitamins and minerals, the ones you can also get from a cheap multivitamin, are just a small part of the total amount of nutrients in foods.
          Therefore, supplements cannot match the variety of nutrients you get from real foods.
          However, many supplements can be beneficial, especially those that contain nutrients that are generally lacking in the diet, like vitamin D.
          But no amount of supplements will ever make up for a bad diet. Not a chance.</p></b>
          <p><b>“Diets” Don’t Work — a Lifestyle Change Is Necessary</b></p>
          <p>“Diets” are ineffective. That is a fact.
          They may provide short-term results, but as soon as the diet ends and you start eating junk food again, you will gain the weight back. And then some.
          Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the only way to ensure long-term weight loss and a lifetime of improved health.</p>
